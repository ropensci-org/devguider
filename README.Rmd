# devguider

Tools for automating processes to manage rOpenSci's DevGuide. Currently includes the following main functions:

1. `devguide_spelling()` to check the spelling of the entire text.
2. `devguide_thanks()` to return a list of people who should be thanked for contributions to the current version.
3. `devguide_urls()` to check whether all URLs given in the Dev Guide actually exist.
4. `devguide_prerelease()` to open a pre-release issue on GitHub for the next release (should be run one month prior to planned release).

An additional utility function, `devguide_path()`, finds the path to the local `devguide` repository.
